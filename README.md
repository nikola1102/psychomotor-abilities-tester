Checking the reaction time to visual and audio stimuli is one of the tests in occupational medicine for the selection of candidates whose future job depends on the speed of reaction in the event of potential danger.

Device based on the Arduino platform was created, which measures the response of subjects to visual and audio stimuli. The measured data is stored on the computer where it is processed and the results are analyzed.

The reaction time to the audio stimulus can be tested by the device at different frequencies of the stimulus signal. The device examines the reaction time to a light stimulus as a simple reaction and an optional reaction by the appearance of light signals of different colors.

The device also contains diagnostics, during which the correctness of the key components of the device, such as buttons, light-emitting diodes and speakers, is tested, as well as calibration, which determines the accuracy of the device.

The functionality of the device was tested in laboratory conditions and all requirements were met.

Key words: reaction time of subjects, simple reaction and optional reaction of subjects, occupational medicine, diagnostics and device calibration
